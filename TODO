TODOs

Parser:
* support for numbers in function names (assume range has max. 3 letters, e.g. ZZZ3 and function names with numbers must have more than 3 letters first)

Mapping/Transformations:
* DirectoryShift based on patterns
* loading of custom functions, does not work now because xl:Expr literals are already parsed
  during reading the mapping model

Execution:
* full support of date, time, and time intervals
* support for BigDecimal (especially when calculating with currency values)
* support for NumberFormats in CSV files (e.g. parsing of strings such as "â‚¬ 1,000.00")
* persistent caching of materialized models in Jena TDB, no need to re-materialize on startup

GUI:
* GUI to support mapping generation (based on Eclipse Workbench)
* debugger
* Experiments with auto-detection of cross tables, ask Reinhard
